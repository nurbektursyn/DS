# EMPLOYEE PROMOTION PREDICTION MODEL
This machine learning project focused on developing a model to predict employee promotions using various machine learning techniques. Key models included GradientBoostingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, and LogisticRegression. The dataset used contained variables like age, department, education, awards won, and training scores. The GradientBoostingClassifier proved most effective, highlighting its robustness in complex datasets. The study advanced HR analytics, demonstrating a data-driven approach to improve decision-making in employee promotions, thereby potentially transforming talent management processes.
